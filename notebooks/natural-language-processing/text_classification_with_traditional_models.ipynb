    "# Text Classification with Traditional Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The Twitter dataset (`tweets.csv`) was scraped from February of 2015 for sentiment analysis on US airline tweets. Contributors were asked to first classify positive, negative, and neutral tweets, followed by categorizing negative reasons (such as \"late flight\" or \"rude service\"). The dataset can be found [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment)\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to train a supervised machine learning model that, given each new tweet, predicts the sentiment class of that tweet (i.e., positive, negative, or neutral). You should choose a traditional classification model, such as Naive Bayes, but try out different feature representation approaches to optimize the performance. "
