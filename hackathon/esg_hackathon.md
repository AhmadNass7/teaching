# ESG Hackathon



## Challenge 1 - ESG Proxy Measures for unlisted SME / PE companies

For large corporates and companies listed on major stock exchanges it has been a standard practice to disclose non-financial and sustainability metrics for many years. Most of these companies have embraced a certain standard around their environmental, social and governance activities, have issued objectives and report against the progress versus these objectives on an annual basis. Many market data providers have standard data sets, that disclose these objectives and metrics on an aggregated level. 

For SME and scale-up / start-up companies these standards and metrics rarely exist and where they can be found, they are extremely variable and very specific to the business model and maturity of the respective company.

We are looking for a way to use publicly available ESG data from large corporates (aka ESG market data) and find a sensible way to use known and existing metrics of smaller companies in order to generate ESG proxy metrics. How can an industry and regional setup combined with certain headcount and balance sheet figures be used to derive the most relevant ESG target metrics (checkout the [ESG Data Convergence Initiative](https://www.esgdc.org/metrics/#guiding-principles) for a sensible set of target metrics)
- Which input data should be used to derive ESG proxy metrics for unlisted companies?
- How best can you obtain these input data points?
- In what form would you present the status quo, the target state and the projected path?
- Which steps of this overall process could you automate and support via technology?
- How can you create a win/win situation for PE/VC portfolio companies and their funds/investors?



## Challenge 2 - ESG Proxy Measures for existing Real Estate Asstes (Bestandesimmobilien)

Each and every real estate object should have an ESG certificate and ideally this certificate includes more details than just the energetic parameters. While the CO2 footprint and the intended CO2 reduction path is the most important metric for each real estate asset, additional metrics like water, waste and socio-economic parameters gain in relevancy to judge a buildings sustainability rating.

And while newly constructed buildings have many of these factors observed during planning and monitored as a part of the Building Infrastructure Management (BIM) many old buildings do have little to none published data points. The aim of this challenge is to create a „digital twin“ of existing and not yet modernized buildings and to use known proxy data points in order to establish the status quo of a CO2 footprint estimate for these buildings . In addition a likely CO2 reduction trajectory should be established by evaluating respective measures like energetic remodeling or replacement of key building components like HVAC in order to achieve a more favorable ESG outlook for each such outdated building.  
- Which input data should be used to derive ESG proxy metrics for outdated, existing buildings?
- How best can you obtain these input data points?
- In what form would you present the status quo, the target state and the projected path?
- Which steps of this overall process could you automate and support via technology?
- How can you create a win/win situation for Real Estate Investment Funds and the individual asset users?
