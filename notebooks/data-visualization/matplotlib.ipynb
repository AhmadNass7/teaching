    "Matplotlib is a multiplatform data visualization library built on NumPy arrays, and designed to work with the broader SciPy stack. Matplotlib package was born, with version 0.1 released in 2003. One of Matplotlib’s most important features is its ability to play well with many operating systems and graphics backends. In recent years, however, the interface and style of Matplotlib have begun to show their age. Nevertheless, we cannot ignore Matplotlib’s strength as a well-tested, cross-platform graphics engine."

    "#### Customizing Matplotlib: Configurations and Stylesheets\n",
    "Matplotlib’s default plot settings are often the subject of complaint among its users. While much is slated to change in the 2.0 Matplotlib release, the ability to customize default settings helps bring the package in line with your own aesthetic preferences.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The version 1.4 release of Matplotlib in August 2014 added a very convenient style module, which includes a number of new default stylesheets, as well as the ability to create and package your own styles. Even if you don’t create your own style, the stylesheets included by default are extremely useful. The available styles are listed in `plt.style.available`. The basic way to switch to a stylesheet is to call `plt.style.use`. But keep in mind that this will change the style for the rest of the session. Let’s create a function that will make two basic types of plot and test different styles."

    "- **Plotting from an IPython shell.** IPython is built to work well with Matplotlib if you specify Matplotlib mode. To enable this mode, you can use the `%matplotlib` magic command after starting ipython. At this point, any plt plot command will cause a figure window to open, and further commands can be run to update the plot. Some changes (such as modifying properties of lines that are already drawn) will not draw automatically; to force an update, use `plt.draw()`. Using `plt.show()` in Matplotlib mode is not required.   \n",

Plotting interactively within an IPython notebook can be done with the `%matplotlib` command, and works in a similar way to the IPython shell.

    "\n",
    "**MATLAB-style interface.** Matplotlib was originally written as a Python alternative for MATLAB users, and much of its syntax reflects that fact. The MATLAB-style tools are contained in the pyplot (plt) interface. It’s important to note that this interface is stateful: it keeps track of the “current” figure and axes, which are where all plt commands are applied. You can get a reference to these using the `plt.gcf()` (get current figure) and `plt.gca()` (get current axes) routines. While this stateful interface is fast and convenient for simple plots, it is easy to run into problems. For example, once the second panel is created, how can we go back and add something to the first?"

    "### plot Versus scatter: A Note on Efficiency\n",
    "Aside from the different features available in `plt.plot` and `plt.scatter`, why might you choose to use one over the other? While it doesn’t matter as much for small amounts of data, as datasets get larger than a few thousand points, `plt.plot` can be noticeably more efficient than `plt.scatter`. The reason is that `plt.scatter` has the capability to render a different size and/or color for each point, so the renderer must do the extra work of constructing each point individually. In `plt.plot`, on the other hand, the points are always essentially clones of each other, so the work of determining the appearance of the points is done only once for the entire set of data. For large datasets, the difference between these two can lead to vastly different performance, and for this reason, `plt.plot` should be preferred over `plt.scatter` for large datasets."
